# Shydactyl

A reskinned [Tridactyl](https://github.com/cmcaine/tridactyl) for when you want
to hide your power level.

## Why

Tridactyl's interface makes it very obvious that it's some sort of power user
thing.

Shydactyl makes it less obvious.

## What's a Tridactyl

> Replace Firefox's default control mechanism with one modelled on the one true editor, Vim.

Their readme is much better than this one, so go there
